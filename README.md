To run this code, simply clone the repository somewhere on your machine with Node.js and React. Then, navigate into the project directory and run

```
npm install
npm run
```

Then navigate a browser to "localhost:3000". Alternatively, you can use

```
npm run start
```
instead of just "npm run" to have npm open a browser tab to localhost:3000 for you.
